Musical Scale Trainer

DESCRIPTION

Welcome to the Musical Scale Trainer project! This program is an experimental tool designed to help users learn musical scales for major and minor keys on the piano. It's built with accessibility in mind, featuring voice menus and other features specifically to assist blind and low-vision users. The program includes a simple synthesizer that provides real-time feedback as you play, generating a correct note sound when a note within the scale is played and an error tone for incorrect notes.

USAGE

Using Musical Scale Trainer is straightforward:

1.  Start the program (more detailed instructions to follow as the project develops).
2.  Use the intuitive voice menus to select the desired scale.
3.  Listen to the program play the scale and describe the corresponding fingerings.
4.  Play along on your MIDI keyboard. The built-in synthesizer will provide immediate audio feedback.

REQUIREMENTS

*   Python 3.7 or later (performance is proving erratic, and testing would be greatly appreciated)
*   MIDI Keyboard

PLATFORM NOTES

This program uses the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech, which relies on underlying speech engines provided by your operating system. This means that certain features might behave differently or require additional configuration depending on your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux). If you encounter issues with speech output, please consult the `pyttsx3` documentation for platform-specific troubleshooting.

A NOTE TO THE COMMUNITY

This project is very much a work in progress and is being shared in its experimental stage to encourage community involvement and collaboration. We believe this tool has the potential to be incredibly valuable for blind and low-vision musicians, and we're eager to work with others to refine it and make it the best it can be. Your contributions, feedback, and testing are invaluable in helping us achieve this goal. We especially welcome input from blind and low-vision users to ensure the program meets their needs effectively.

CONTRIBUTING

We warmly welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're a coder, a musician, a tester, or simply someone with a passion for accessibility, your help is appreciated. If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, new features, or accessibility enhancements, please feel free to contribute.
